# Future AI Features for JRN

This document outlines the planned AI features for the JRN diary application, to be implemented in a future phase.

## 1. Smart Summarization
- **Daily Recap**: Automatically generate a 1-2 sentence summary of the day's entry.
- **Weekly Insights**: Analyze entries from the past week to highlight recurring themes or key events.

## 2. Mood & Pattern Tracking
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze entry text to detect dominant emotions (Happy, Sad, Anxious, Neutral).
- **Trend Visualization**: Graph mood changes over time to help specific triggers or improvements.

## 3. Temporal Chat (Time Travel)
- **Talk to Past Self**: Use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to "chat" with past entries. Ask questions like "How did I feel about this job last year?"
- **Simulate Future Self**: Project current trends forward to give perspective or advice based on goals and current state.

## 4. Privacy Considerations
- Ensure all AI processing is done with respect to user privacy, possibly using local models or anonymized data if sending to cloud APIs.
